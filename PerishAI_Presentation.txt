PerishAI: Smart Shelf-Life Aware Routing for Perishable Goods
Team: [Your Team Name]
Date: July 2025

Slide 2: Problem & Motivation
----------------------------
- Perishable goods often spoil before delivery, causing waste and financial loss.
- Need for intelligent routing to maximize freshness and minimize waste.

Slide 3: Solution Overview
--------------------------
- AI/ML-powered pipeline for shelf-life prediction and route optimization.
- End-to-end workflow: data simulation, modeling, prediction, optimization, and visualization.

Slide 4: Data Simulation Process
-------------------------------
- Simulates realistic delivery data with units in all columns.
- Features: product_type, time_in_transit (hours), temperature_exposure (°C), humidity (%), storage_conditions, shelf_life_left (days).

Slide 5: Shelf-Life Prediction Model
-----------------------------------
- XGBoost regression model.
- Preprocessing: one-hot encoding, scaling.
- Predicts remaining shelf life for each delivery.

Slide 6: Route Optimization Approach
------------------------------------
- Rule-based: sort deliveries by predicted shelf life (ascending).
- Ensures products closest to expiry are delivered first.

Slide 7: Dashboard Demo
-----------------------
- Streamlit dashboard shows:
  - Optimized delivery plan
  - Product freshness tracker
  - Sustainability metrics (waste avoided, CO₂ saved)

Slide 8: Results & Impact
-------------------------
- Improved delivery efficiency and reduced waste.
- Data-driven insights for supply chain optimization.

Slide 9: Future Work
--------------------
- Integrate real-time data feeds.
- Advanced optimization algorithms.
- Broader sustainability metrics.
